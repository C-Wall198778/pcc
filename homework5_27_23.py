#Make an if, else statement that prompts a user for a number, then compare that number to 3 cases (1 if, 2 elifs) and then has an else case (catchall).
#Have python compare the number entered to a true/false modulo comparison to figure out if the number enetered is a multiple of 2,3,5, or none of the above.
#Have 1 print statement in each case informing the user of the multiple case (EX: "4 is multiple of 2", 4 is the value entereed by user).
